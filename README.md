1. we read all the test and train tables given

2. then we name the variables accordingly, "subject", "activity", and the names given in file "features"

3. we colunm bind both test and train data in the following order, subject, activity, X-s.

4. then we combine train and test data with rbind (head would be train and tail would be test)

5. then we factorize the activities and give them the corresponding names ("WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", etc.)

6. next we selct the data with only mean and st.dev measurements extracted.

7. now the last step involves selecting mean for each of the variable along with each subject and activity. this step is missing in the code.
